Welcome to this module! In this lesson, we will explore the core concepts required to master the subject matter.

## Overview
This module is designed to provide you with a solid foundation. Here are the key learning objectives:
1. Understand the basic principles.
2. Setup your development environment.
3. Run your first successful script.

## Core Concepts

### Concept 1: The Basics
In AI Engineering, understanding the fundamentals is critical. Large Language Models (LLMs) operate by predicting the next token based on a vast corpus of training data.
> "The key to mastering AI is a deep understanding of its foundational mechanics."

\`\`\`python
# Example Code Snippet
def run_model(prompt):
    model = load_model("llama-3.2")
    response = model.generate(prompt)
    return response

print(run_model("What is the future of AI?"))
\`\`\`

## Practical Exercise
Take 5 minutes to run the code above in your local environment. If you encounter errors, ensure your dependencies are installed:
\`pip install transformers torch\`

## Summary
You have now completed the introduction to this topic. Make sure to review the provided documentation before moving on to the next module.
